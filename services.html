<p class="services">Why is vacant staging so important? Only 10% of home buyers can actually visualize the potential of a vacant home. Without any furniture, there is no frame of reference and it's incredibly difficult to tell the scale and size of a room. When a buyer does not have answers to their questions, they often walk away.<br><br>Using the transformative art of home staging and design we will elevate the home and ensure market readiness. We utilize classic and on-trend furnishings, custom art and quality accents that recall a unique sense of place.<br><br>Our tailored solutions allow potential buyers to emotionally connect to the home, increasing the chance of them visualizing how this home could be the one.</p>
