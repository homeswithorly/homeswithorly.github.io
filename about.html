<h1 style="margin-top:50px; margin-bottom: 10px;">About Me</h1>

<p style="width: 600px; margin-left: 5%;">
Born and raised in the UK, Orlina has been happily living in the US for over 20 years. After years of working in the corporate world with extensive travel, and living both in Los Angeles and New York City, her journey led her to the serene beauty of the Catskills. Here, surrounded by nature and community, Orlina's passion for design organically transpired into buying, renovating, and selling properties in the Hudson Valley. Through these efforts, Orlina has crafted an appreciation for the undeniable impact and art form of home staging.

Obsessed with beautiful furniture, both vintage and contemporary, with a particular affection for Midcentury Modern pieces, Orlina distills storytelling and a distinct sense of place in her projects.
