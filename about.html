<h1 style="margin-top:50px; margin-bottom: 10px;">About Me</h1>

<p style="width: 600px; margin-left: 5%;">
Born and raised in the UK, but happily living in the US for over 20 years now. After a life in the corporate realm with extensive travel, my journey finally led me to the serene beauty of the Catskills. Here, surrounded by nature's splendor, my passion for design truly blossomed.
</p>

<p style="width: 600px; margin-left: 5%; margin-top: 0.7px;">
With hands-on experience buying, renovating, and selling properties, I've come to appreciate the incredible impact of staging.
</p>

<p style="width: 600px; margin-left: 5%; margin-top: 0.7px;">
I'm obsessed with beautiful furniture, both vintage and contemporary, with a particular affection for Midcentury Modern pieces. I love capturing before-and-after photos, and there's nothing more rewarding than witnessing a client's amazement at a beautifully transformed room. 
</p>
