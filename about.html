Hi there! I'm Orly, a real estate and design professional who has seamlessly transitioned into the world of staging. After a life in the corporate realm with extensive travel, my journey finally led me to the serene beauty of the Catskills. Here, surrounded by nature's splendor, my passion for design truly blossomed. With hands-on experience buying, renovating, and selling properties, I've come to appreciate the incredible impact of staging. It's more than just decorating---it's about transforming spaces to highlight their full potential. I'm obsessed with beautiful furniture, both vintage and contemporary, with a particular affection for Midcentury Modern pieces. I love capturing before-and-after photos, and there's nothing more rewarding than witnessing a client's amazement at a beautifully transformed room. From charming cottages to sprawling estates, we offer customized staging solutions that reflect the property's unique style and appeal to the target market. Check out our packages and if you don't see what you need, give us a call---let's create something amazing together!
